# Wealth Management Agentic AI

This repository contains a prototype of an **Agentic AI System for Wealth Management**, designed to assist users in making informed financial decisions by analyzing their financial goals, investment portfolios, and market trends.

## Project Overview

The core goal of this project is to transition from **rule-based decision logic** to **AI-powered intelligence** for more personalized, adaptive, and real-time investment strategies. The current version uses predefined rules to guide portfolio recommendations. Future iterations aim to:

- Incorporate **AI/ML models** for better personalization
- Compare suggestions with **real-time asset prices**
- Use **clustering, classification, regression**, and **reinforcement learning** for user behavior analysis and portfolio optimization

## üîç Features

- **Rule-Based Investment Suggestions**: Basic financial guidance based on predefined thresholds and portfolio weights.
- **Agentic Planning**: Structured decision-making approach simulating agent-like behavior.
- **Goal-Oriented Analysis**: Evaluates progress toward long-term goals like retirement, savings, or wealth growth.

 üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- *(Planned)* scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenAI Gym
- *(Planned)* API integrations for live market data

## Current Limitations

- Uses **only rule-based logic** for decisions
- Does **not yet utilize AI** for personalized predictions or optimizations
- Lacks **real-time price integration** (to be added in the AI version)

##  Work in Progress

**Current Status**:
- Functional rule-based wealth agent  

üõ†**Next Steps**:
- Integrate ML models (classification, regression, clustering)
- Apply **Reinforcement Learning** for dynamic portfolio strategy
- Compare AI recommendations with **real-time asset prices**
